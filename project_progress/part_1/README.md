# Part 1: Text Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis  
###IMPORTANT NOTE: This code is designed to run in Google Colab
##PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project implements a text processing and exploratory data analysis system for fashion product data. The system processes product information from a JSON dataset, performs text cleaning and preprocessing, and prepares the data for information retrieval tasks.
##SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR GOOGLE COLAB
###Set Your File Path - IMPORTANT!

"""
Teacher Path - UPDATE WITH YOUR PATH
docs_path =
"""

Make sure your JSON file is in Google Drive and UPDATE THIS PATH with your actual file location of fashion_products_dataset.json.
After setting up the path, run all cells sequentially. The code will:
Load and display the raw data
Clean and preprocess all text fields
Extract product details into separate columns
Perform statistical analysis
Generate visualizations
REMEMBER: The most important step is correctly setting the docs_path variable to point to your JSON file in Google Drive.
